<section id="about_text" class="section">
Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger is an Austrian-American actor, film producer, businessman, former bodybuilder and politician who served as the 38th governor of California between 2003 and 2011.
<br/>
<br/>
Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15 and went on to win the Mr. Universe title at age 20, subsequently winning the Mr. Olympia contest seven times; he remains a prominent figure in bodybuilding, and has written many books and articles on it. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him.
<br/>
Schwarzenegger retired from bodybuilding and gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit with a sequel in 1984.
<br/>
Schwarzenegger also acted in verious popular movie series like The Terminator and The Expendables.
<br/>
<br/>
In his early part of life Schwarzenegger was obsessed with training and doing physical activities, he began weight training in 1960 when his football coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over football as a career. He later said, "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting."
<br/>
From this point forward, Schwarzenegger whole life was surrounding training and weight lifting, and at 17, he officially started his competitive career.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the people who Schwarzenegger looked to the most was Yuri Petrovich Vlasov, Vlasov was a Russian heavyweight weightlifter, writer and politician. At age 14, Schwarzenegger watched the World Weightlifting Championships and saw Vlasov win the championship title and becoming the first human being to lift 200 kg over his head. After that Schwarzenegger made it to the back stage of the event and saw Vlasov and even shook his hand.
From that interaction, as a 14 year old Schwarzenegger was blown away from the interaction with Vlasov and he began admiring Vlasov and even put his photo above his bed to inspire him and motivate him to get better and be like Vlasov.
<br/>
<br/>
To this day Schwarzenegger still train to keep his physique even at age 74 and he also still act from time to time in some movies.
